# gpfuzz
Uploading everything of GPFuzz, those data is already uploaded:
1. The Clients (`AFL++4.01a`, `gpaflpp`, `gpecofuzz`,based on EcoFuzz)
2. Trained model checkpoints 
3. Seeds used to train the model and act as a seedpool.
4. The Server (Note: the server is a simple demo for demonstrating/evaluating the model and the entire fuzzing process, it can be further modified to adapt different management system like ClusterFuzz);
5. The source code of training/inferencing the model

The rest of the code is still processing (working with code style/source quality, etc.) will be uploaded here, including:

1. Document of how to use the GPFuzz.
